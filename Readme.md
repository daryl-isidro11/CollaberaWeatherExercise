# Weather App Exercise
This is a submission for a weather app exercise for Collabera by Daryl Arvin Isidro.
## Setup
To be able to use this app, you will need an OpenWeather API key. 
If you don't have one, you may get one from https://openweathermap.org/
After getting it, you will need to go to the following directory:
**app/src/main/res/values/configs.xml**
The XML file should contain a string value named **api_key**. Replace the value there with your own API key.
Once done, you should be able to run the application properly.
